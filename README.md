# Diary writing with Gemini

Some say that writing diary in a foreign language is a good way to improve your skills in that language.
However, it's not always easy to get instant and customised feedback for your diary, especially if you want the explanations in your own mother tongue.

This project aims to provide a simple and friendly interface to ask Google's Gemini to edit your diary entry. 

## getting started

1. set `GEMINI_API_KEY` envvar (**Make sure to `export`**)
2. run `go run main.go`
